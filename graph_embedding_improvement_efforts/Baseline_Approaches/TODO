  All Baseline Approaches

  Baseline-1: Counting node-types and event-types in the subgraph ("Simple counting")
      - Included in Box document -- https://app.box.com/file/1417292586765?s=wn4qma2fvmaam5jzlmxvk6irmddi8s02

  Baseline-2: Counting N>1 gram event-type features after flattening the subgraph ("Flattened graph N>1 gram event features") 
      - Included in Box document -- https://app.box.com/file/1417292586765?s=wn4qma2fvmaam5jzlmxvk6irmddi8s02
      - This is a "known" baseline.

  Baseline-3:  Counting N>1 gram event-type features after flattening the subgraph + counting node-types 
               ("Flattened graph N>1 gram event features + Simpe counting of node-types") 
      - TODO: Add to Box document
      - This is a more fair baseline for "Thread-level N>1gram approach" where it uses node-type counts as its feautres
