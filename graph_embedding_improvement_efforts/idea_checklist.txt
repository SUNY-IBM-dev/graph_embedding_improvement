[ Ideas to try:]

[Priority-1] TRY: Prof Guanhua said to consider “concatenating” the temporal-Ngram with graph-embedding? 
        Graph-embedding serving as additional info.  
   — “could” write a script : Integrating the “n-gram” part with “graph-embedding” part, referring to:
         -- /data/d1/jgwak1/tabby/graph_embedding_improvement_JY_git/analyze_at_model_explainer/analyze_RF_with_explainer.py
         -- /data/d1/jgwak1/tabby/graph_embedding_improvement_JY_git/N_gram_hyperparameter_tuning/n_gram_hypeparam_tuning.py

   ^--- /data/d1/jgwak1/tabby/graph_embedding_improvement_JY_git/graph_embedding_improvement/concat_ngram_and_graph_embedding.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Priority-2] Weighted-sum
   - Give weights on particular threads
   --> What is the logic behind process starting threads
   --> So if a process runs a particular application, is there a straightforward way to distinguish threads that correspond to the actual activity of that application and threads that are more for background activities ?
      ^-- This seems like a challenging task in genenal.
          Looked into the Threadstart event ETW log-entries, and didn't see any interesting pattern.
          
   --> TODO: Write a script that groups events by thread (take into account possibility of thread-id reuse).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Priority-3] Incorporate n-hop information flow with directed graph, similar to the neighborhood aggregation in GNN.
   --> Refer to the neighborhood aggregation code of, say, 'pytorch GIN-conv layer' 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Priority-4] Incorporate N-gram (temporal information) directly into graph-embedding?
   -- fit_transform for all edges in training data , in parallel? , then aggregate , and transform? 
      (this will need some good amount of effort, LESS importance ** )

[ Priti is also running the "Signal-Amplification suggested approach suggested by Prof Guanhua way back" ]
