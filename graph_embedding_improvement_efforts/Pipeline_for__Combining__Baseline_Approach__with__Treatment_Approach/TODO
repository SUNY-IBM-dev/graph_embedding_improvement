-- Put Baseline model as the starting-point for model-improvement.
   Add extra features on top of baseline-features (e.g. glboal N-gram features, simple-count features),
   instead of replacing or removing the baseline-features from the beginning.

-- TODO : Write a pipeline that allows different combinations (e.g. concat, weighted-concat) 
          between different pairs of baseline-features and treatment features 
          (e.g. simple-count-basleine-fetures X thread-level-ngram-features 
                OR global-N-gram-baseline-fetures X thread-level-ngram-features
                OR simple-count-baseline-features X standard-message-passing-features)

           This is for efficiency in such experiments (to avoid writing a whole new main file for each combination of baseline and treatment)
           New treatment or baseline approach can be incorporated by either importing or copying over the function.
           (e.g. get_thread_level_N_gram_events_adjacent_5bit_dist_dict() from Trial_7__Thread_level_N_grams__N_gt_than_1__Similar_to_PriorGraphEmbedding/thread_level_n_gram__n_gt_1__similar_to_asiaccs_graph_embedding.py)
