1. Use multi-graph (edge == event)
2. Each event should be associated with actual timestamp , not the normalized one, 
   since this approach is to message passing 

   -- > Could just directly use the multi-graph subgraphs for 2. “Temporally incorrect information flow with standard message passing” problem: Link: Diagram with Texts”
        Because the “timestamp-float” is directly corresponds to the timestamp (e.g. 13332324324),
        Since timestamp-float preserves the “global” temporal-ordering of the subgraph, instead of being local to a component.

        (Check get_events_order )
